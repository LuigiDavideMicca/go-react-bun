# The typed bridge

Your Go handlers, read by static analysis, become the TypeScript types your React pages are checked against. No OpenAPI spec to maintain, no generation step you invoke by hand, no runtime reflection. This page covers writing API routes, what `borgogen` can see, how Go types map to TypeScript, the generated client, and where the analysis honestly stops.

This is one of the five reasons borgo exists: types that are generated cannot drift from the code they describe, because nobody maintains them.

## API routes

API routes are Go files in `api/`. Annotate a handler with a route directive and it is mounted for you:

```go
//borgo:route GET /api/tasks
func ListTasks(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	borgo.JSON(w, http.StatusOK, TaskList{Tasks: tasks})
}
```

Prefer explicitness? `borgo.Handle("GET /api/tasks", ListTasks)` in an `init()` works identically and feeds the same types. `main.go` stays five lines: import your `api` package, call `borgo.Serve()`. The Go side imposes no database and has zero dependencies — bring GORM, sqlc, `database/sql`, or nothing.

A malformed directive fails the generator *before* it writes anything, so a typo can never leave behind a half-generated `borgo.gen.go` that keeps breaking the build after you fix it. Registering the same pattern twice, or registering after `borgo.Serve()` has snapshotted the table, panics with a message naming the file and line.

## What borgogen reads

`borgogen` runs automatically on every `api/*.go` change in dev, and as part of `borgo build` and `borgo export`. It analyzes your `api` package with `go/ast` and `go/types`, and writes two files:

- `.borgo/api-types.d.ts` — a TypeScript interface per Go struct, plus a route map from pattern to request and response types
- `api/borgo.gen.go` — the mounting code for `//borgo:route` handlers

It finds a route's **response type** from `borgo.JSON[T]`, `borgo.WriteJSON`, and inline `json.NewEncoder(w).Encode(v)` calls reachable from the handler — including through helper functions, both inside the `api` package and across other packages of your module:

```go
func respondTask(w http.ResponseWriter, status int, task Task) {
	borgo.JSON(w, status, TaskItem{Task: task})
}

//borgo:route GET /api/tasks/{id}
func GetTask(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	respondTask(w, http.StatusOK, Task{ID: 1, Title: "Buy oranges"})
}
```

The route still types as `TaskItem`. Extracting a helper is a refactoring, not a hole in your types.

A handler with more than one success shape produces a **union**, and error envelopes written with a constant status of 300 or more are deliberately excluded — the client throws an `ApiError` on any non-2xx, so those bodies never reach the caller as data:

```ts no-check
"GET /api/search": { response: Suggestions | Results };
```

## Typed request bodies

Decode with `borgo.Bind[T](r)` and the route's request is typed too, so the client *requires* a matching body:

```go
type TaskCreate struct {
	Title string `json:"title"`
	Body  string `json:"body"`
}

//borgo:route POST /api/tasks
func CreateTask(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	body, err := borgo.Bind[TaskCreate](r)
	if err != nil {
		borgo.BindError(w, err)
		return
	}
	borgo.JSON(w, http.StatusCreated, TaskItem{Task: Task{Title: body.Title}})
}
```

The generated entry now carries both directions, and a wrong body fails `tsc`:

```ts no-check
"POST /api/tasks": { response: TaskItem; request: TaskCreate };
```

`Bind` reads at most 1 MB, so a route expecting a small payload cannot be fed gigabytes; `borgo.BindMax[T](r, 8<<20)` raises the cap where a route legitimately needs it (`limit <= 0` disables it), and borgogen types it identically. `borgo.BindError(w, err)` answers with the right status as JSON — `413` past the limit, `415` for a declared non-JSON content type, `400` for malformed JSON — and the proxy relays those verbatim, so the browser sees the API's answer rather than a wrapped error page.

## How Go types become TypeScript

Fields follow `encoding/json` semantics, because that is what will actually be on the wire:

| Go | TypeScript | Note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `string`, `int`, `float64`, `bool` | `string`, `number`, `boolean` | |
| `*T` | `T \| null` | |
| `[]T`, `[N]T` | `Array<T>` | |
| `[]byte` | `string` | Go marshals it as base64 |
| `map[string]T` | `Record<string, T>` | numeric keys too — Go writes them as strings |
| `time.Time` | `string` | RFC 3339 |
| `json.RawMessage` | `unknown` | |
| a type with `MarshalText` | `string` | see the addressability note below |
| a type with `MarshalJSON` | `unknown` | override it with `//borgo:type` |
| `json:"name,omitempty"` | `name?: T` | strings, numbers, bools, slices, maps, pointers — not structs, which Go always writes |
| `json:"name,omitzero"` | `name?: T` | Go 1.24+ |
| `json:"-"` | omitted | but `json:"-,"` means a field literally named `-` |
| `json:",string"` | `string` | numbers and bools quoted on the wire |

Embedded structs are flattened using the standard library's own depth rules: a field on the outer struct shadows a promoted one at greater depth, and two promoted fields tied at the same depth cancel out, exactly as `encoding/json` drops them. Fields promoted from an *unexported* embedded type are included, because they are marshalled. Two same-named structs in different packages get distinct interfaces, prefixed by package. Recursive types terminate. A JSON tag that is not a valid TypeScript identifier is emitted quoted, so `json:"user-name"` cannot break your typecheck.

One deliberate imprecision, worth knowing because it is otherwise invisible. When a type's `MarshalText` has a **pointer receiver**, `encoding/json` calls it only where the value is addressable — inside a slice, or through a pointer — and not for a plain struct field. The same named type can therefore reach the wire in two different shapes within one response. borgogen types it as `string | number`: correct in every position, rather than precise in one and wrong in another. Give the marshaler a value receiver and the type is simply `string`.

## Type overrides

A type borgogen cannot see through — anything with a custom `MarshalJSON` — maps to `unknown`. Override the mapping for any named type with a directive anywhere in the `api` package:

```go
//borgo:type gorm.io/gorm.DeletedAt string | null
```

## The nil slice trap

One place where Go's own JSON semantics can surprise you, and the bridge deliberately does not paper over it:

```go no-check
var tasks []Task            // nil, not empty
db.Find(&tasks)             // still nil if there are no rows
borgo.JSON(w, 200, TaskList{Tasks: tasks})
```

A **nil** slice or map marshals to `null`, not `[]` — so the client receives `{"tasks": null}` while the generated type says `Array<Task>`, and `tasks.map(...)` throws. The bridge types the *intent*, because `Array<Task> | null` on every collection would push a null check into every consumer for a case your handler controls.

The fix belongs in Go, and it is one line:

```go no-check
tasks := []Task{}           // empty, marshals to []
```

Make it a habit in any handler that returns a collection.

## The generated client

Loaders and actions receive `api`, a client typed by the map above. The route pattern is the key, path params come from the pattern itself, and the response type follows:

```tsx
import type { LoaderContext } from "borgo-framework";

export async function loader({ params, api }: LoaderContext) {
  const { task } = await api("GET /api/tasks/{id}", { params: { id: params.id } });
  return { task };
}
```

Options are `params`, `query`, `body`, `headers` and `timeout` (milliseconds; off by default, because a hard default would break streaming and long-polling callers). Non-2xx responses throw `ApiError`, which carries `.status` and a size-capped `.body`:

```tsx
import { ApiError, redirect, type LoaderContext } from "borgo-framework";

export async function loader({ api }: LoaderContext) {
  try {
    return { me: await api("GET /api/me") };
  } catch (error) {
    if (error instanceof ApiError && error.status === 401) return redirect("/login");
    throw error;
  }
}
```

The client forwards the browser's cookies on every call, so Go sees the session during server rendering, and forwards `Set-Cookie` back — which is what makes a login action actually log the browser in. `apiUrl` is the escape hatch: the raw base URL, for anything the typed client does not model.

Loader and action code is stripped from client bundles at build time, so server-only imports and secrets used there never reach the browser. CI greps the built assets for a sentinel string to keep that honest.

The same analysis types [WebSocket events](realtime.md#typed-events) from `borgo.PushT` calls.

## Generated files and CI

Both generated files are committed to your repository, so a fresh clone typechecks before anyone runs `dev`. Keep them in sync the way this repo does: run the generator in CI and fail if the output differs from what is checked in.

One trap worth knowing: TypeScript skips dot-directories, so `.borgo/api-types.d.ts` must be named explicitly in `tsconfig.json`:

```json
{ "include": ["**/*", ".borgo/api-types.d.ts"] }
```

Every template ships this. If your editor suddenly cannot find the route types, that line is the first thing to check.

## Honest limits

The bridge is static analysis, and it says `unknown` rather than guessing. What it cannot see:

- helper functions **outside your module** — a response written by a vendored or third-party package;
- an encoder stored in a variable before use (`enc := json.NewEncoder(w)`) rather than the inline chain;
- dynamically chosen types: `borgo.JSON(w, s, any(x))` types as the static type of the expression, which is `any`;
- anything reached through reflection.

The escape hatch is visible, not silent: you get `unknown`, and a compile error at the point of use, rather than a plausible-looking type that is wrong.

One decoding subtlety, on the Go side rather than the TypeScript one: `encoding/json` matches field names case-insensitively and lets the last duplicate key win, so `{"Username":"a","username":"b"}` binds `b`, and `{"USERNAME":…}` still matches. `borgo.Bind` inherits this, because changing it would break the standard library's contract. The practical rule: never validate a JSON body in one layer and act on it in another — bind once, in the Go handler, and validate what *that* decode produced.
